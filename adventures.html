    <h2 id="parachute">Parachuting</h2>
        <p>This is a thrill to do! It is a nerve-racking experience and definatly is not for the faint of hart. This involves a training session and unless you have gone before you will be jumping with a partner! You are flown up in the air by plane and jump out. After free falling for a moment your partner will deploy a parachute. You glide down overlooking the amazing veiw and mountains of Utah!<br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute#:~:text=The%20modern%20parachute%20was%20invented,also%20sketched%20his%20device%20beforehand.&text=In%201797%2C%20Andr%C3%A9%20Garnerin%20made,frameless%22%20parachute%20covered%20in%20silk.">More info.</a> </p>
    <h2 id="rafting">Rafting</h2>
        <p>This is an activity I have done throughout my whole life in Utah! There are many Lakes and rivers that one can go on. Wether just drifting down or around on a canoe or going rafting on the rapids it always a blast and a way to get out in nature and stay cool in the heat. There are many place in National parks especially that you can rent equipment or have river guides take you down rivers and keep you very safe. It's always a thrill to go with family or freinds and laugh together as you are rowing through rapids or have splash wars. <br> <a href="https://www.theoutbound.com/theoutbound/10-utah-lakes-and-rivers-to-explore-this-summer">Lakes and rivers</a> to visit on your own.</p>
    <h2 id="hiking">Hiking</h2>
        <p>I'm pretty sure most of us that were born in Utah learned to hike before we could walk! There are millions of hikes that you can find all over Utah that are adventurous, challenges but almost all of the have fantastic veiw either at the end our during the hike. We are hoping to guide you to some of our favorites in whatever place you choose to visit in Utah.<br> <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/us/utah">Here are some of Utah's top trails</a></p>
    <h2 id="biking">Biking</h2>
        <p>Although I myself cannot claim to be a biker I have enjoyed taking my mountain bike on many beautifule trails. My favorite place to bike being Zion's National park. If your lazy on some days like me they have a shuttle with a bike rack that can get you up the hard hills. other place wil more challanging trails are usually out in the Moab deserts. I will say that you might want to save those for when you practiced mountain biking! Other than that you can simply take a bike ride through some beautiful towns such as Moab or St George. <br> <a href="https://www.utahmountainbiking.com/idx-main.htm">Utah Mountain Biking</a> </p>
    <h2 id="climbing">Rock Climbing</h2>
        <p>Rock climbing is something we have not done very much but it is still an exhilarating experience. There are many fantastic mountains and rock structures all over Utah making it possible to you to climb almost anything!(Obviously only if its permitted and you have the training). There are many trained guides all over the place that will take you cimbing up rock faces or help to climb to an area where you can ropel down!<br> <a href="https://57hours.com/best-of/rock-climbing-utah/">More info.</a></p>
