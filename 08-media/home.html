        <p>We have in Utah our entires and have absolutly loved the adventures that were available to us just a few miles or hour away! We love it so much that we want to share it with the rest of the world and wanted to help them find the places to go if anyone ever dicided to go to Utah (which they should;)). <br> To start off we would like to introduce you to what is in Utah! Utah has 5 National Parks. Yes, you heard me correctly, <b>FIVE!</b> All of witch have different adventures to do that you can find yourself and adventures that you can expereince. </p>
    <h2>The Mighty Five!</h2>
        <ul class="parks">
        <li>Bryce Canyon National Park</li>
        <li>Arches National Park</li>
        <li>Zion National Park</li>
        <li>Canyonlands National Park</li>
        <li>Capitol Reef National Park</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We are here to help you find the activities that we have enjoyed the ost and if needed are worth paying for! Besides the National parks there are many other town and cities that have their own adventures that can get those items on your bucket list checked off!This is why:</p>
    <blockquote>It is not death most people are afraid of. It is getting to the end of life, only to realize that you never truly lived. There was a study done, a hospital study on 100 elderly people. Facing death, close to their last breath they were asked to reflect about their life's biggest regret. Nearly all of them said they regretted <b>not the things they did</b> but the things they <b>didn't do. </b>The risks they never took... I was talking to a pilot and he told me that many of his passengers think planes are dangerous to fly in. But he said, "Actually, it is a lot more dangerous for a plane to stay on the ground." I said, "What? Like how does that sound?" Well, he said, he said, "Because on the ground the plane starts to rust, malfunction and wear, much faster than it ever would if it was in the air." As I walked away I thought, "Yeah, makes total sense." Because <b>planes were built to live in the skies.</b> And every person was built to live out the dream they have inside. So it is, perhaps, the saddest loss to live a life on the ground without ever taking off. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja-n5qUNRi8">-Prince Ea</a> <!-- This is link to whole the wholl video where the quote is from. -->
